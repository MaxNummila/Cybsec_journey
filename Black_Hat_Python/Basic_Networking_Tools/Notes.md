# Black Hat Python

## Notes
- Many tasks give you the fundamental structure for the tech, say a TCP proxy, and then hints at what one can do with it.
- Progress has been slowed down since moving more between cities
- Trying to research everything that feels uncertain

## Struggles
- There is a lot that I feel that one has to know or research for moving forward in the book.
